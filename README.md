## Description

A program for users to catalog and organize  music.

<!-- Brainstorming
Make a program for users to catalog and organize their music. This could be a CD, vinyl or even a tape collection.

Artist - (category)
Record - (item)
A Record should be an object. 
would hold a Title, 
hold a Artist name 
new record, enter the record title, and list out all of their records.
Add a feature that allows users to add an artist to a record.

After that, let users list out all the artists and choose an artist to see which records are by that artist.

After testing all back-end logic and developing an MVC front-end for this application, expand your Record model to include relevant properties like picture(s), song titiles, a journal entry on the music, and so on. Integrate these into your front-end MVC application.

At the very least, the front end MVC web application should support RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.
